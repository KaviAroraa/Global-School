            <li>A hostel is a form of low-cost, short-term shared sociable lodging where guests can rent a bed, usually a bunk bed in a dormitory, with shared use of a lounge and sometimes a kitchen. <br><br>
            <li>Rooms can be mixed or single-gender and have private or shared bathrooms. <br><br>
            <li>Private rooms may also be available, but the property must offer dormitories to be considered a hostel. <br><br>
            <li>Hostels are popular forms of lodging for backpackers, cycle tourists, and gap year travelers. <br><br>
            <li>They are part of the sharing economy. Benefits of hostels include lower costs and opportunities to meet people from all over the world, find travel partners, and share travel ideas. <br>
