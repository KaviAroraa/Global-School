            <li>Swimming is useful to children in many ways. <br><br>
            <li>It not only strengthens the shoulder and thigh muscles, but also allows children to breathe deeply, and sustain breath under water for long periods of time. <br><br>
            <li>Realizing the importance of swimming for fun and as a sport, children are provided specific time slots and weekend slots for practice of swimming.<br><br>
            <li>In GIIS, swimming is conducted by trained coaches and is supervised carefully for the safety of each and every student involved in the activity.<br>
